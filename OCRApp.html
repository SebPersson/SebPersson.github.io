			<li>The app provides information about the different obstalces, what the obstacles require and different techniques to overcome them.</li>
			<li>The app includes different workouts aimed towards OCR.</li>
			<li>The app includes a bunch of different "tricks-of-the-trade" from experienced runners conserning everything from preparations to what gear to use</li>
			<li>The app will feature videos and information from people of different experience ranging from beginners to happy amateurs to OCR elite runners.</li>
