			<h3> About me </h3>

			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>My three major hobbies in life at the moment are <b>music</b>, <b>training</b> and <b>games</b>.</p>
			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>Music has always been a big part of my life. I began playing the guitar when i was 10 and haven't stopped yet. My favourite music genre is Rock music even though i listen to more genres. I like to playing along the songs and throw in some improvisations here and there. I might even post a vid or two to Instagram or Facebook if I feel especially motivated. I dream of one day owning my own Gibson guitar and a Marshall amplifier. I recently acquired the amp...</p>
			<h3>Obstacle Course Race</h3>
			<p>Late summer 2015 i ran my first OCR. It was Tough Viking in Djurg√•rden, Stockholm. 15 km of running, mud, ice, fire and tons of fun. I was immediately hooked. Since then I've ran as many races as I've been able to and enjoyed every second of it and made many friends because of it. One of my coolest OCR experiences was running Maritiman Extreme Challenge in Gothenburg, a part of the Military Fitness OCR Golden Trophy, when I as part of the race climbed onto and jump from a war ship</p>
			<h3>Games</h3>
			<p> I have played different types of games most of my life, ranging from board games and role playing games to videogames and computer games. Most recently I have really enjoyed gathering a group of friends, having dinner, play a board game or two and just enjoy each others company. Social and fun!
